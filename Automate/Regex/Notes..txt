- Simplified language for finding text
    - re.compile(<pattern>) pass raw string to escape everything
    - \d for digit
    - compile() has search() method that you pass string to. group() to get the occurence
        - has findAll() to get every occurence

- Groups and Pipe
    - Parentheses to mark groups
    - Pass index to group() to get which set of parentheses you want
    - \ to escape to look for reserved regex character literallt
    - | to look for multiple things like prefix Car(maker|paint) with keep prefix and look for all those words
