Terminology
	- Interactive shell issues one command at a time 
	- Expression: value and operator, reduces to single value
	- All values belong to a Data Point
	- String * int will replicate the string
	- Variable: assign value to, keep in computers memory. Evaluates to what it contains
	- Statement: does not evaulate to a single statement, commonly called instruction

First Program
	- input() retrieves user input
		- will always return a string
	- len() for length, str()/int()/float() for cast/convert to different data types
	- Execution in python starts at top and moves down
	- Functions are mini programs

Flow Control
	- Comparisons evaluate to boolean value
	- Integers and strings never equal to eachother; floats and integers can be equal
	- not, or, and for Boolean operators
	- Indentation determines block of code to determine level
	- Condition can use truthy/falsy. Blank string is falsy, 0 is falsy
	- New block begins after a colon has been added
	- While loop: only while condition is true
	- For loop: execute only a specific number of times
	- bool() to return boolean value of whatever you pass it
	- break: get out of loop immediately, without checking condition
	- continue: skip this iteration, jump back to start and check condition
	- range() range object, for sequence of integers. Optional 3rd argument for 'step' or increment it increases
