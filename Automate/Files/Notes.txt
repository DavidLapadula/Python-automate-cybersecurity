        - path.join(), string value of path for all argument pass
        - chdir() to change the working directory
        - path.abspath(<pathtofile>) - will give abolsute when passed relative path
        - path.relpath(<): relative path bewtween two folders
        - path.dirname(): get up until last directory
        - path.basename(): get last item of a path after last slash
        - path.exists(): if the file exists
        - path.isFile(), and isDir()
        - path.getsize() to get size of file
        - listdir(): return list of strings files and folders in path
        - makedirs(): to make a new folder in either relative or absolute path

Files
    -  open(): pass filename to open, opens file in read mode, and returns file object
        - open in read/write mode determines what you can do to the file
            - pass 'w' for write mode which overwrites file, or 'a' for append things at the end of the file
        - can call read() to get contents, then close()
        - readlines() returns list of strings instead of all text
        - write(): to write strings to file
shelve
    - module for writing/reading binary data
    - Access like key value pairs in a dictionary
        - Can store non text data structure (list, dictionary) and then get again
    - Have keys() and values() method

shutil
    - copy() to move files from one folder to another. First arg is file and second is destination
        - provide filename and will rename the file
    - copytree(): provide folder and destination and will copy the entire folder
    - move(): provide file and destination and will move it
        - rename requires using move() but same directory as destination and a different name

Delete files
    - os.unlink(): pass file to remove
    - os.rmdir(): pass directory to remove, needs to be empty
    - shutil.removetree(): delete folder and all its contents
    - send2trasj module for sending to trash instead of deleting permanently

Walk through dir tree
    - os.walk()
        - returns foldername(path as string), subfolders(as list), and filenames as list()
    - Goes through every folder underneath, it walks the entire tree
    - Can then change, delete, move anything in that directory tree
