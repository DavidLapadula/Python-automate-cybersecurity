- Excel
    - Workbook can contain multiple sheets
    - Column, Row = cell
    - openpyxl
        - load_workbook(<path>) to open
        - get_sheet_by_name(<sheet name>) or sheetname[<sheetname>]
        - get_sheet_names()
        - sheet[<col, row>].value
        - sheet.cell(row=<>, col=<>)
            - better for looping because can just use row/col indexes
        - Workbook() - make new WB with single sheet
            - Can then access values in the empty sheet
            - save(<filename>) on Wb instance to save file
            - create_sheet(<index=>, <title=>) to make new sheet, index for where to save
            - sheetN.title(<new name>)

        - Call write(<file object>) on writer object and pass in new file
- Word
    - Document is whole object > Paragraph objects > Run model
    - Document() to make new object
        - add_paragraph(<content>)
